# tpsExec

Windows - Download Win folder and run exe(not tested)

Linux - Download Lin folder and run x86_64 file(./location/to/file in console)

Keys:
    wsad - movement
    lmb - shoot
    rmb - aim
    r - reload
    c - crouch
    ctrl - change weapon mode(currently assault riffle and sniper riffle)
    lAlt - change looking side

(to do: find better place to store executables, because github wont allow files bigger than 100mb, and I have 70mb currently. Also I need better idea how to store files on branches)
